I made this project in 2023. I had tried to make a Wordle clone very early in myJavaScript studies (my background had previously been in Python) and struggled. This project was a chance to see what I'd learned and feel more confident that I had improved.

The main things I wanted to practice with this project were:
* JQuery
* CSS Animations
* Just thinking through the logic of a simple app like wordle and how I would recreate it.
